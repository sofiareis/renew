# üè† What it does?
The app name was chosen to represent the fact that it helps refugees as they start a new life in a new country, hence, renew. The app features a community function where users are grouped into communities based on where they came from and where they have immigrated to. Within these communities, users can post and comment about any questions or resources for users to learn from each other. Additionally, there is a map feature that filters for nearby food banks, hospitals, and areas with recent criminal activity.
