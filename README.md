## Inspiration
With a growing number of conflicts worldwide, tens of millions of refugees are being forced to abandon their home countries in search of safety, being thrown into a deeply frightening and uncertain future. Renew is meant to help refugees in these situations as they navigate life in a new and unfamiliar country.

## What it does
"Renew" is a community-based app where users can find a support network with individuals from their country of origin, wherever they may find themselves. Within these communities users can connect, post, and comment questions or resources. Additionally, there is a map feature that filters for nearby food banks, hospitals, and unsafe areas.

# What's next for renew ?

- Culture: Upcoming events in your community
